### **Interesting Fact 1: Most Common TV Show Rating**

To find the most common rating for TV shows, we can use a SQL query to count the occurrences of each rating for TV shows.

```sql
SELECT rating, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM NetflixShows
WHERE type = 'TV Show'
GROUP BY rating
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### **Interesting Fact 2: Average Duration of Movies**

To calculate the average duration of movies, we need to extract the numeric part of the duration for movies and then compute the average.

```sql
SELECT AVG(CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(duration, ' ', 1) AS UNSIGNED)) AS avg_duration
FROM NetflixShows
WHERE type = 'Movie';
```
