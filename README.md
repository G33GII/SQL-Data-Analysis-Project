# SQL Data Analysis Project: Netflix Shows

## Overview

This repository contains the project files for the SQL Data Analysis Project focusing on Netflix Shows. The project aims to analyze a dataset of Netflix shows using SQL queries, visualize insights through charts, and present findings via a pitch deck presentation.

## Project Components

### 1. Dataset

- **Chosen Dataset:** Netflix Shows
- **Description:** The dataset includes information such as show titles, directors, cast, country of origin, release dates, ratings, genres, and descriptions.

### 2. Tools Used

- **MySQL:** Used for data storage and SQL queries.
- **MySQL Workbench:** Utilized for database management and visualization.
- **Microsoft Excel:** Used for creating charts to visualize insights.

### 3. Project Workflow

1. **Data Import:** The dataset was imported into MySQL Workbench.
2. **Data Exploration:** SQL queries were used to explore and derive insights from the dataset.
3. **Data Visualization:** Insights were visualized through charts created in Microsoft Excel.
4. **Presentation:** A pitch deck was prepared to summarize findings and insights from the analysis.

## Files Included

- **`SQL_Queries.sql`:** Contains SQL queries used for data exploration and analysis.
- **`SQL_Data_Analysis_Presentation.pptx`:** Pitch deck presentation summarizing the project.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Installing MySQL:**
   - Follow instructions based on your operating system to install MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench.
   
2. **Importing Dataset:**
   - Create a database in MySQL Workbench (e.g., `NetflixShowsDB`).
   - Import the dataset CSV file into MySQL Workbench or use `LOAD DATA INFILE` command.

3. **Running SQL Queries:**
   - Use MySQL Workbench to run SQL queries provided in `SQL_Queries.sql` for data analysis.

4. **Creating Charts:**
   - Use Microsoft Excel to recreate charts based on the data insights provided.

## Project Presentation

- **Pitch Deck:** Refer to `SQL_Data_Analysis_Presentation.pptx` for a detailed presentation of findings, insights, and methodology used in the project.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of SQL for data analysis and visualization in the context of Netflix shows data. It highlights the process of importing, querying, and presenting insights from a dataset using MySQL and Microsoft Excel.
